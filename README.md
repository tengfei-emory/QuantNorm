# QuantNorm
Mitigating the adverse impact of batch effects in sample pattern detection

QuantNorm modifies the distance matrix obtained from data with batch effects, so as to improve the performance of sample pattern detection, such as clustering, dimension reduction, and construction of networks between subjects. The method has been published in Bioinformatics (Fei et al, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty117).

# Installation Guide
```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github('tengfei-emory/QuantNorm')
library(QuantNorm)
```

# Preprocessing

Before putting the data in QuantNorm, please feel free to conduct preprocessing, such as cell filtering, log-transformation, or standardization (zero mean and one standard deviation). Currently, QuantNorm only features simple built-in preprocessing task, such as log- transformation and standardization. 

The choice of preprocessing will probably affect the result of running QuantNorm. Since the behavior is pretty much dataset-specific, it is good to try different preprocessing methods.


# Example 1 - Human and Mouse Brain RNA-seq Data

The dataset (Zhang et al, 2016) is downloaded from http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brainseq2/brainseq2.html. The data consists of brain RNA-seq measurements for human cells and mouse cells. There are 41 human cell samples and 21 mouse cell samples, the types of which is the column name of the data. For each cell sample, there are 15041 gene counts. The dataset can be loaded by data(brain).

```{r}
library(rgl) #for 3D PCA display

data("brain")

#Numbering the cells by cell types
celltype <- c(rep(1,8),rep(7,6),rep(1,12),rep(2,1),rep(3,5),rep(4,3),rep(5,2),rep(6,4),
              rep(1,2),rep(1,4),rep(2,2),rep(3,6),rep(4,2),rep(5,2),rep(6,3))

#Assigning the batch number that the 62 subjects belonging to.
batches <- c(rep(1,41),rep(2,21))

#Plot the 3D PCA for the uncorrected batch effect data
plot3d(princomp(1-cor(brain,method='spearman'))$scores[,1:3], col=celltype, size=10)

#QuantNorm correction
ccc <- QuantNorm(brain,batches,tol=1e-4)
plot3d(princomp(ccc)$scores[,1:3], col=celltype, size=10)

#ComBat
library(sva) #(may need to install package sva from bioconductor)
cleandat <- ComBat(log(brain+1),batches)
ccc.1<-1-cor(cleandat,method="spearman")
plot3d(princomp(ccc)$scores[,1:3], col=celltype, size=10)
```

# Example 2 - ENCODE Data for Human and Mouse Tissues
The dataset used in this example is reproduced according to Gilad et al (2015). The data contains the log-normalized counts for 13 different tissues for human and their counterparts in mouse. Our algorithm obtains clusters by tissues. The dataset can be loaded by data(ENCODE).

```{r}
library(pheatmap) #drawing heatmap
data("ENCODE")

#Before correction, the subjects are clustered by species
pheatmap(cor(ENCODE))

#Assigning the batches based on species
batches <- c(rep(1,13),rep(2,13))

#QuantNorm correction
corrected.distance.matrix <- QuantNorm(ENCODE,batches,method='row/column', cor_method='pearson', logdat=F,standardize = T,tol=1e-4)
pheatmap(1-corrected.distance.matrix)
```

# Incorporating with the SC3 method (Under Construction)

As mentioned in our paper, our method can improve the performance of a current powerful clustering method, Single-Cell Consensus Clustering ([SC3](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SC3.html), Kiselev VY et al, 2017). The following code shows how we can plug in the corrected distance matrix to the SC3 algorithm in R. For more detailed tutorial about SC3, please refer to [this page](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SC3/inst/doc/SC3.html) by Vladimir Kiselev.

Suppose for a data matrix DATA, we have obtained the 2 corrected distance matrix from QuantNorm, one is based on spearman correlation and one is based on pearson correlation:

```{r}
pearson.cor <- QuantNorm(DATA,batches,method='row/column', cor_method='pearson', logdat=F,standardize=T,tol=1e-4)
spearman.cor <- QuantNorm(DATA,batches,method='row/column', cor_method='pearson', logdat=F,standardize=T,tol=1e-4)
```
Then we could use SC3 in the following way (SC3 codes are borrowed from [SC3 bioconductor manual](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SC3/inst/doc/SC3.html#singlecellexperiment-qc-and-scater)) 

```{r}
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(SC3)
library(scater)

# Construct a SingleCellExperiment object

sce <- SingleCellExperiment(assays = list(normcounts = as.matrix(DATA)), colData = known.cell.type.vector)

# Run the SC3 algorithm
sce <- sc3_prepare(sce)
sce <- sc3_estimate_k(sce)
sce <- sc3_calc_dists(sce)

# Replacing the original pearson and spearman distance matrices by the corrected ones.
sce@metadata$sc3$distances$spearman <- spearman.cor
sce@metadata$sc3$distances$pearson <- pearson.cor

# Continue finishing the standard steps
sce <- sc3_calc_transfs(sce)
sce <- sc3_kmeans(sce, ks = 13)
sce <- sc3_calc_consens(sce)

# Check clustering results and ARI
library(mclust)
svm_labels <- colData(sce)$sc3_13_clusters
adjustedRandIndex(cell.type[,1], svm_labels)
```
